## 🚦 How to Use

### 1. **Initial Setup**

```bash
# Start the server (if not already running)
npm run dev

# The seed script has already created:
# - Default permissions
# - Sample roles
# - Test users with different access levels
```

### 2. **Access User Management**

- Navigate to `/users` in the hotel-client
- Only Master Admins and Property Admins can access
- Property Admins can only manage users in their property

### 3. **Access Role Management**

- Navigate to `/roles` in the hotel-client
- Only Master Admins can access
- Initialize permissions first if starting fresh

### 4. **Create Staff Roles Quickly**

1. Go to Role Management
2. Click "Initialize Permissions" (if not done)
3. Use "Create Hotel Roles" or "Create Restaurant Roles" buttons
4. Customize permissions as needed

### 5. **Add New Staff Member**

1. Go to User Management
2. Click "Add New User"
3. Fill in basic information
4. Select appropriate roles
5. User will be created with proper permissions

## 🔄 Navigation Integration

The new components are integrated into the existing navigation system:

- **Navigation items** appear based on user permissions
- **Role-based access control** prevents unauthorized access
- **Seamless integration** with existing Dashboard and Layout components

## 📋 Test Accounts

Use these accounts to test different permission levels:

```
Master Admin:
- Email: admin@system.com
- Password: admin123
- Access: Full system access

Property Admin (Hotel):
- Email: admin@hotel.com
- Password: hotel123
- Access: Hotel property management

Property Admin (Restaurant):
- Email: admin@restaurant.com
- Password: restaurant123
- Access: Restaurant property management
```

## 🔍 Next Steps

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user and role management. You can extend it by:

1. **Adding more granular permissions** for specific features
2. **Creating department-based roles** (e.g., Security, Accounting)
3. **Adding time-based access controls** (shift schedules)
4. **Implementing approval workflows** for sensitive operations
5. **Adding audit logging** for user actions
6. **Creating bulk import/export** for large user datasets

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permission system
- **Property Isolation**: Users can only access their property data
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt password security
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure API access

This implementation follows security best practices and provides a robust foundation for managing staff and their access levels in your hotel/restaurant management system.
